# OADA API Reference Implementation


## Introduction


This open source implementation provides a basic skeleton implementation for
OADA REST APIs. This reference implementation is in Java and is built using a
combination of:
  * Spring MVC 
  * Spring Security (integrated with Spring SAML and Spring OAuth). 

The goal of this reference implementation is not to be exhaustive in terms of
data formats or backend storage systems. It is intended to be a reference
implementation that illustrates how OADA Federated Identity can be
implemented and on which various parties can build their implementations.

## OADA Federated Identity

### Authentication

[Single Sign On Support via SAML](docs/saml.md)


### Authorization

[OAuth 2.0 Support](docs/oauth.md)


### Tying it all together 

Having set up authentication and authorization, we tie them together with
Spring Security. The main interface that provides authentication services in
Spring Security is the AuthenticationManager. This class is a Bean instance
that is registered using the "authentication-manager" namespace element.

AuthenticationManager is responsible for the userâ€™s authentication, and it
contains a provider to hold the users and passwords. In most real world
implementations, this provider directs to a JDBC, where all users are stored
with their encrypted passwords. In case of WebSSO, we do not have to handle any
users and passwords, since we delegate this to the Identity Provider, so we
change the declaration of our server to point to the authentication manager of
the SAML Service Provider. This manager has a provider
(SAMLAuthenticationProvider or some child class). This class implements the
authenticate() method, which performs authentication of an Authentication
object. 

So, in summary, we end up with these changes:

```
<authentication-manager xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/security" alias="authenticationManager">
    <authentication-provider ref="samlAuthenticationProvider"/>
</authentication-manager>

<http authentication-manager-ref="authenticationManager" entry-point-ref="samlEntryPoint">
    <intercept-url pattern="/oauth/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>
    <intercept-url pattern="/**" access="IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY"/>
    <anonymous enabled="false"/>
    <custom-filter before="FIRST" ref="metadataGeneratorFilter"/>
    <custom-filter after="BASIC_AUTH_FILTER" ref="samlFilter"/>
</http>
```

## Installation

### Requirements

* Supported application server or container (viz. Tomcat, Jetty)
* Java 1.6+ SDK
* Maven 3 or later.

### Compilation & Testing

When building from source, sample web app can be built using
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

```
mvn clean install
```

This command builds OADAAPIRef.war. The maven build file also includes the
"jetty plugin". So you could test the application like so:

```
mvn jetty:run
```

### Deployment

You can deploy this in a servlet container of your choice.

**In order for WebSSO via SAML to work, web app must be deployed at root
context. The redirect url specified in Service Provider metadata is tied to
root context.**


### Usage

Once you have deployed the sample web app, attempt to retrieve an OAuth token like so:

```
http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?grant_type=implicit
```

You will be asked to select an Identity Provider. Select http://idp.ssocircle.com and click "Login". You will be redirected to:

```
https://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login?module=peopleMembership&goto=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.ssocircle.com%2Fsso%2FSSORedirect%2FmetaAlias%2Fssocircle%3FReqID%3Da3j024f680cihe0b54bj7f4ajh13hie%26index%3Dnull%26acsURL%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8080%252Fsaml%252FSSO%252Falias%252FdefaultAlias%26spEntityID%3Dsaml-test-app%253Atest-oada-2%253Asanfrancisco%26binding%3Durn%253Aoasis%253Anames%253Atc%253ASAML%253A2.0%253Abindings%253AHTTP-Artifact
```

Log in using the test credentials (username: tcc-oada-1 password: testoada) and you should be redirected back to

```
http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?grant_type=implicit
```

and you should see a sample response like so:

```
{
	access_token: "ed3c1e7e-a377-45ec-96c2-8c6c37e4e2b0kmmxgw9sIAXKsQS20t9JLQ==",
	token_type: "Bearer",
	expires_in: 899999999
}
```
 	
## Thanks

The reference implementation borrows from Spring OAuth and Spring SAML examples
from [Spring](http://spring.io/). Many thanks to those teams.
